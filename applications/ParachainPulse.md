## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

The Polkadot and Kusama's number of parachains is continuously increasing, along with their open source developer communities. As a result, there is a growing need for an accessible way to easily monitor, analyze and compare the development activity across different Polkadot and Kusama's parachains on Github. 

Using GitHub as a means to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the data across various parachains necessitates a considerable level of effort and analysis, which could be simplified if automated. Consequently, understanding the progress of developer activity for parachains on Polkadot and Kusama becomes difficult since the data is dispersed throughout GitHub.

The solution presented by CrossChain Labs aims to tackle the issues described and provide clarity regarding the open-source developer ecosystem of both Polkadot and Kusama's parachains. This will be accomplished through the scraping of data associated with each Polkadot and Kusama's parachain from Github.

ParachainPulse will leverage the available data to generate a visually appealing dashboard that facilitates the monitoring of the ecosystems’ growth, the progression of developers and their projects, as well as the contributions made to different parachains within the Polkadot and Kusama organizations.

The inclusion of insightful statistics within the analysis will provide users with a comprehensive view of the evolution of ecosystems and facilitate comparisons between parachains. This will enable users to identify the best performers and encourage parachains to easily pinpoint areas that require further improvement.

ParachainPulse is a follow-up project to the previous grant (DotPulse)[https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/DotPulse.md], that will extend the scope to all parachains in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.

### Project Details

By aggregating all the necessary data in one place, ParachainPulse provides a comprehensive view of the open source development activities taking place across the various parachains of Polkadot and Kusama. ParachainPulse will enable users to:
- track the ecosystem's growth, developer progress, and project advancements within the Polkadot & Kusama and their parachains.
- facilitate comparisons between different parachains based on their number of developers, active developers, projects, active projects, contributions, and contributions growth over the last 6 months
- visualize a dedicated webpage for each individual parachain that possesses details on active developers, active projects, monthly contributions made over the past year, recognition of top developers of the month, and the number of active developers out of the total count in the preceding 30-day period.
- to filter and search through developers and their associated projects for each parachain.
- access information regarding the total number of contributions made by each developer to the parachain's ecosystem, as well as the number of contributions made within the past 30 days.
- can view the number of projects that a developer has contributed to, and how many of those projects were active during the last 30 days.

### Ecosystem Fit

ParachainPulse aims to offer interested parties the ability to track various aspects regarding the growth of ecosystems, developer progress, and project advancements within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems. 

This will be achieved through the provision of comprehensive statistics in the analysis, which will enable users to gain a thorough understanding of the evolution of these ecosystems and facilitate comparisons between different parachains.

The availability of such information will ease the identification of the best-performing parachains, as well as areas that require further improvement, thereby encouraging the organizations to enhance their performance.

## Development Status :open_book:

The number of parachains of Polkadot and Kusama is constantly increasing, as are their communities of open-source developers. This growth creates a need for a user-friendly approach to monitoring, analyzing, and comparing development activity across the different Polkadot and Kusama parachains on GitHub.

To obtain a thorough understanding of the data across various parachains, using GitHub requires significant effort and analysis that could be streamlined through automation. Therefore, tracking developer activity progress for Polkadot and Kusama's parachains becomes challenging since the data is so dispersed on GitHub.
